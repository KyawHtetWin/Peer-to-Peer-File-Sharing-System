# Distributed Peer-to-Peer Network File Sharing System

## Overview
This project introduces a powerful and decentralized file-sharing system built upon a distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) network architecture. It empowers users to exchange files seamlessly and securely without relying on a central server, fostering a more robust and privacy-focused sharing environment.

## Motivation
In today's interconnected world, the need for efficient and privacy-aware file sharing has never been greater. Traditional file-sharing platforms often come with limitations and privacy concerns. This project addresses these issues by offering a decentralized solution that puts users in control of their data.

## Features
- **Decentralization:** Eliminates the need for a central server, reducing single points of failure and enhancing robustness.
- **Privacy:** Ensures user data remains private and secure, with no centralized entity holding sensitive information.
- **Scalability:** Scales effortlessly as more users join the network, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.
- **Efficiency:** Utilizes efficient P2P protocols to optimize file sharing and minimize latency.
- **User-Friendly:** Offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface for a seamless sharing experience.
